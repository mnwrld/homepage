      <description>For our Women in Tech series , we interview again and again - as the name suggests - women who work in technical professions. This time we visited Airbus, one of the largest aerospace and defence companies in the world. The day started at the Center for Applied Air Research. Three women, with different backgrounds, reported on their path and their work at Airbus: Daniela Lohwasser, Sandra Bour Schaeffer and Sine Spr√§tz.</description>
