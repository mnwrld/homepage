      <description>Women Techmakers Hamburg to moinworld Hi I am Florian. I was already a part of the community when it just started out as the Women Techmakers Meetup. I think Diversity is important in any field and I like contributing to making a change. I am a software developer and have been interested in computers since I was a child of around 5 years old. The first topics that caught my interest were computer game, which then made me want to learn more about computers in general.</description>

      <description>I was born in Germany, grew up in Denmark and studied in Great Britain. After studying psychology for four years, I did research as a psychologist at a hospital in Copenhagen and quickly realised that it was nothing for me: the work had no impact and was too &amp;lsquo;slow&amp;rsquo; for me. That&amp;rsquo;s when I got in touch with the tech world: I joined the London/Munich Tech Start Up KOMPAS as Community Lead to get a feel for the startup world.</description>

      <description>Hey everybody, I&amp;rsquo;m Joyce Marlen Paquo. As a former student of Gender Studies and Pedagogy, I am studying for a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in the fields of personnel and management development, career orientation and political consulting. In addition to research, I work in the field of education. And as it is, whether in my studies or at work, the nebulous word &amp;ldquo;digitization&amp;rdquo; is used all over the place. Looking for a voluntary internship, I stumbled across moinworld at the end of 2017 - the perfect combination of my interests (gender &amp;amp; education) and curiosities (IT &amp;amp; startup).</description>
