      <description>Some impressions from our kick off in Hamburg last thursday at the Google Office We met last Thursday to find out what happened to the Women Techmaker Meetup three years after it was founded. Meanwhile the Meetup has over 2600 members in Hamburg and we have founded a non-profit association called moinworld e.V. to get even more women excited about IT.
Since the association was founded two years ago, there have not only been the well-known Meetups, which usually take place every two weeks, but also programming courses in which you can learn to code in a structured way.</description>

      <description>The award honours initiatives that introduce information technology topics in schools, vocational training and universities. &amp;ldquo;The IT skills shortage is hampering innovation, digitisation and growth in the Hamburg metropolitan region,&amp;rdquo; says Raphael Vaino, explaining the background to the award, which is therefore looking for initiatives that promote sustained interest and competence among children, young people and young adults.
moinworld has taken 1st place at this year&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;ITEC Cares Award&amp;rdquo; of the IT-Executive Club of Hamburg@work.</description>

      <description>What is the intention behind women techmakers hamburg? We want to change the IT world in a positive way by encouraging more women and girls to code and supporting them in their careers. Our future is digital and we think that women and men should have the same possibilities in shaping that future. Software changes every industry: agriculture, automobile, retail. It would be a great advantage, if a bigger part of the population could also read and write this code.</description>
