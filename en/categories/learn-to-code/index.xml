      <description>Summer Camp in cooperation with three of Hamburg&amp;rsquo;s tech companies For the second year in a row we held our Summer-Coding Camp. Sixteen young girls spent three days developing their programming skills in three different companies, mostly without any prior experience in coding. The workshops took place this year at Google, XING SE and SHARE NOW. In addition, the junior coders were able to exchange ideas directly with the developers working there and gain insights into various IT professions.</description>

      <description>Why are there so few women in IT? It&amp;rsquo;s a question I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked ever since I founded moinworld. Not even a tenth of the IT departments today are staffed by women. It should not depend on gender whether a person is able to help shape our digital future.
“Demand for skilled ICT professionals is growing: 90% of jobs require basic digital skills. As a new Commission study on “Women in the Digital Age” shows, more women in digital jobs could create an annual €16 billion GDP boost in the EU, not least by improving the start-up environment, as female owned start-ups are more likely to be successful.</description>

      <description>moinschool at the district school Alter Teichweg On 06.02.2019 the second round of project moinschool started at another school in Hamburg. moinschool has set the goal to inspire young girls for IT and to show them that technology is not only for boys. Especially during school time, when young people get information about their professional future and are shown their strengths and weaknesses, there are still big hurdles that prevent girls from getting interested in technical professions.</description>

      <description>Learn to code in Hamburg&amp;rsquo;s schools We started our project moinschool with one idea in mind: to take away the fear and “I can’t do this” attitude girls have towards technology. As Marrie Curie said, “you don’t have to be afraid, you just have to understand everything”. We wanted to give the girls a chance to understand how programming works, and to encourage them to become creators of their future worlds, not just mere users.</description>

      <description>Moinschool started in September to integrate more female students into our community We started our project moinschool in Hamburg at the event TINCON Hamburg where we had a workshop with aluminum boats which illustrated how computer science is about problem solving. To take that a step further, we continued with design thinking session last week back at the school. Design thinking sounds like one of the latest buzz-words, but in reality it is nothing more than problem solving, in a less tranditional sense.</description>

      <description>moinwold Hack- and Coworking-Night at XING – not your regular hacknight In September we started our first Hack- and Coworking-Night in addition to our programming classes. You probably made use of study groups at university or high school and you already know that sometimes it is more fun to study in a group. Learning how to code is a journey and we would like to provide you with as many opportunities as possible to stay on your track.</description>

      <description>Moinschool starts in September to integrate more female students into our community All good things are worth waiting for! Our new project moinschool starts in September. We have noticed that with our programming courses  conferences  andMeetups in Hamburg  and Munich  we reach a lot of motivated women of different age groups, but unfortunately school girls are still underrepresented. Therefore our school project moinschool is starting this school year at the reform school winterhude in Hamburg .</description>

      <description>Moinworld is a non-profit organization. The name moinworld is a hint to &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;, the first words every program starts with.
Our goal Our goal is to create a developer community where women and girls have the same opportunities as men to help shape the digital future. We hope that at some point 50% of software development and management positions in tech and IT will be filled by women. We achieve this by strengthening women: Through IT education and the support of a helpful network.</description>

      <description>The Code to your Future - Programming workshop for high school graduates Last week we held our successful, first programming workshop for high school graduates! We consider it essential to address young women and girls in particular and to convince them of the exciting work in the technical and IT areas. To achieve our goal of creating a development community where women and men have equal opportunities to shape the digital future, we have organized a workshop for young women who are in a gap year between school and university.</description>
