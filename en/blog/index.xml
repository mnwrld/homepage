      <description>Why are there so few women in IT? It&amp;rsquo;s a question I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked ever since I founded moinworld. Not even a tenth of the IT departments today are staffed by women. It should not depend on gender whether a person is able to help shape our digital future.
“Demand for skilled ICT professionals is growing: 90% of jobs require basic digital skills. As a new Commission study on “Women in the Digital Age” shows, more women in digital jobs could create an annual €16 billion GDP boost in the EU, not least by improving the start-up environment, as female owned start-ups are more likely to be successful.</description>

      <description>An evening to explore what comes before we can make use of technology Technology is shaping how we do things for example how we go shopping, how we communicate with eachother, how we diagnose illnesses or how we collaborate and with whom on projects. The ability to extend our power of human thought with digital tools has become an essential part of our everyday lives and work. We all need to understand how, when, and where computers and other digital tools can help us solve problems, and we all need to know how to communicate with others who can assist us with computer-supported solutions.</description>

      <description>Some impressions from our kick off in Hamburg last thursday at the Google Office We met last Thursday to find out what happened to the Women Techmaker Meetup three years after it was founded. Meanwhile the Meetup has over 2600 members in Hamburg and we have founded a non-profit association called moinworld e.V. to get even more women excited about IT.
Since the association was founded two years ago, there have not only been the well-known Meetups, which usually take place every two weeks, but also programming courses in which you can learn to code in a structured way.</description>

      <description>Learn to code in Hamburg&amp;rsquo;s schools We started our project moinschool with one idea in mind: to take away the fear and “I can’t do this” attitude girls have towards technology. As Marrie Curie said, “you don’t have to be afraid, you just have to understand everything”. We wanted to give the girls a chance to understand how programming works, and to encourage them to become creators of their future worlds, not just mere users.</description>

After studying psychology for four years, I did research as a psychologist at a hospital in Copenhagen and quickly realised that it was nothing for me: the work had no impact and was too &amp;lsquo;slow&amp;rsquo; for me. That&amp;rsquo;s when I got in touch with the tech world: I joined the London/Munich Tech Start Up KOMPAS as Community Lead to get a feel for the startup world.</description>

To take that a step further, we continued with design thinking session last week back at the school. Design thinking sounds like one of the latest buzz-words, but in reality it is nothing more than problem solving, in a less tranditional sense.</description>

As a former student of Gender Studies and Pedagogy, I am studying for a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in the fields of personnel and management development, career orientation and political consulting. In addition to research, I work in the field of education. And as it is, whether in my studies or at work, the nebulous word &amp;ldquo;digitization&amp;rdquo; is used all over the place. Looking for a voluntary internship, I stumbled across moinworld at the end of 2017 - the perfect combination of my interests (gender &amp;amp; education) and curiosities (IT &amp;amp; startup).</description>

      <description>What is the intention behind women techmakers hamburg? We want to change the IT world in a positive way by encouraging more women and girls to code and supporting them in their careers. Our future is digital and we think that women and men should have the same possibilities in shaping that future. Software changes every industry: agriculture, automobile, retail. It would be a great advantage, if a bigger part of the population could also read and write this code.</description>
